> Many of the main empirical questions in macroeconomics are the same as they have been since at least the Great Depression. What are the sources of business cycle fluctuations? How does monetary policy affect the economy? How does fiscal policy affect the economy? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Those new to our field may be tempted to ask, “How can it be that after all this time we don’t know the answers to these questions?” The reason is that identification in macroeconomics is difficult.

[What is Repo Rate?](https://www.financialexpress.com/what-is/repo-rate-meaning/1748807/)  

>Repo rate, also known as policy rate or repurchase rate, is the rate at which RBI lends money to banks. When the central bank reduces the repo rate, banks get money at a cheaper rate, and in turn, they reduce interest rates for borrowers. This is similar to the Repo rate for US Treasury and primarily a short term lending instrument with the terms of repurchase decided at the time of borrowing.

RBI recently (October 1, 2019) announced a <[lending rate which would be linked to this repo rate](https://www.financialexpress.com/what-is/repo-linked-lending-rate-rllr-meaning/1715264/), and hence makes repo rate an active interest rate which could determine credit supply in the market.

> is the rate at which RBI provides interest on deposits with the RBI to commercial banks. albeit for shorter duration of deposit.

> An important clarification is required - Reverse repo rate can only be maintained for short term, and hence it is different from Interest on Reserves for commercial banks by the Fed.

__Using R for Macroeconomic Data__

In the first module, we will set up our toolkit for being a macro-economist. You would need to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and its GUI (graphical user interface) - the [R studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Both are required for reading data from Excel, doing simple analysis from the data and understand what we mean by short-run and long run in macroeconomics.
