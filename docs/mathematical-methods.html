<h1>Mathematical Methods</h1>
<div id="course-synopsis" class="section level2 unnumbered unlisted">
<h2>Course Synopsis</h2>
<p>This is the first part of a two-part course on mathematical methods for undergraduate students in economics. This course follows the preparatory camp which is mandatory for all students admitted into the BA. (Hons) Economics program at the School of Government and Public Policy at OP Jindal Global University. The aim of this course is to introduce the students to basic tools and techniques of mathematics that form the foundation of modern economics. Learning mathematics could be anxiety inducing for students, but we try and overcome this fear of mathematics by using it to understand economic concepts. We believe that this context helps facilitate learning of mathematics itself and align the usage of this language to economics.
After taking this course, you would be able to appreciate the mathematical structure of concepts in economics and be able to identify the appropriate methods crucial for economic analysis. This course directly follows from the preparatory camp and assumes knowledge of content therein. However, we will start this course following the exposition in our core texts. We begin with a simplistic economic model. The economic variables and their relationship in the model will introduce us to concepts in sets, relations and functions.</p>
<p>While the simple model helps us present these, we realize that the world of economics is more complicated than a single equation. It comprises of interconnections which require more description and many more equations. We use insights from the study of a system of equations to understand a complex model which such interconnections.</p>
<p>But the world is not always linear. So even with many such equations, we fail to understand the world of economics. This brings us to the exploring non-linear equations and the world of calculus. We realize that our economic model is growing in mathematical complexity and we can understand such models by applying simple rules of calculus. We learn calculus by understanding the economics in these models and relying on the economic intuition in turn to learn calculus.</p>
<p>We conclude this course by understanding optimal choices by agents in economics and exploring its mathematical structure.In reality, such choices are often under constraints but we leave that discussion to a follow-up course.</p>

<div id="course-goals-learning-outcomes" class="section level2 unnumbered unlisted">
<h2>Course Goals (Learning Outcomes)</h2>
<p>Participants who successfully complete the course are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Break down an economic model into its components i.e variables, parameters and relation. They should be able to do this for all courses in economics with a mathematical structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the concept of a solution to economic models and be able to draw economic insights from the solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Concisely write a system of linear equations in matrix notation and identify the types of matrices involved.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve a system of matrices through the shortest possible solution and understand the equivalence of matrix solutions with solution through substitution.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand the intuition of rates of change and be able to explain comparative statics of a model.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply total derivatives to isolate moving parts of an economic system.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve an unconstrained optimization and be able to make inference from the solution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use examples from micro and macro economics in the hope that it would facilitate you to think about the mathematics underlying other courses. At the end of this course, you should be able to get rid of your anxiety with mathematics and hopefully employ it to simplify the economics in the rest of the program.</p>

<div id="mathematics-using-computers" class="section level2 unnumbered unlisted">
<h2>Mathematics using Computers</h2>
<p>Some of the topics could be solved using rudimentary programming using common programming languages as well as software. The course website would have more information on study material and sessions for programming. The intention of introducing this in the first semester is to again get you started with active learning and to break the monotony of online classes.</p>
