Here is a short introduction and here’s my latest blog post. Research My research focuses on transmission of economic policy across open economies. I examine transmission in a variety of setting. I analyze regional economies which form a part of a fiscal unions in my paper “Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India’s States”, which is currently under review. I also look at transmission of fiscal policies for the Eurozone in my paper “Trade Transmission of Fiscal Policies in a Currency Union”. I am broadly interested in the effect of policy transmission for these regions especially due to their huge interdependence, which makes policy making a strategic and consequnetial exercise for these regions - in addition to its contributions to supra-regional economic performance. In similar spirit, I examine transmission of Demonetization shock on the Indian economy in a paper “Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization” in which we look at the disaggregate effects of India’s demonetization through short payment choices for consumers. This is largely regional transmission of this monetary shock. Teaching I teach Macroeconomics I and II, International Trade, Mathematical Methods for Economics, Statistics II all of which are compulsary courses for BA.(Hons) Economics at O.P. Jindal Global University. Ongoing courses: EC 13: Macroeconomics II - Fall 2020 EC 01: Mathematical Methods for Economics I, Fall 2020 "],
["bio.html", "Bio", " Bio I completed my Ph.D. from the Department of Agricultural Economics at the Louisiana State University back in 2018. My dissertation research is on fiscal policy transmission in currency unions in which I study policy spillovers among countries in the European Monetary Union. Before graduate school at LSU, I completed M.Phil from the Center for Development Studies, Kerala, India and M.A. Economics from Center for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University. I also had a short stint in mass-communication after my undergraduate studies from Delhi University, but returned to economics without much ado. My latest CV is here. Blogs and More Latest Blog post On a Hike at Dandenong, Tremont, VIC Quotable Quotes On writing in research Thomson, W. (1999). “The process of writing itself will lead you to new knowledge. Learn to write but also write to learn.” Mike Monteiro You don’t sell a house by talking about sheetrock. You sell it by getting the buyer to picture themselves in the neighborhood. Deirde McCloskey The big secret in economics is that good writing pays well and bad writing pays badly…Rotten writing causes more papers and reports to fail than do rotten statistics or rotten research. On life, our times and existence: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen” On the origins of a central bank: “The British government has never paid off the £ 1,200,000 loan that created the Bank of England in 1694. In exchange it gave the merchants who provided the money the exclusive right to print banknotes against this debt, giving birth to the central bank and much of the architecture behind the world’s financial system.” Keynes on the profession of economics: “The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique for thinking, which helps the possessor to draw correct conclusions.” Michael Woodford on the role of fiscal policy: “Fed needs to accept the role of ‘Fiscal Policy’ instead of pushing unconventional monetary policy with the reassurance that monetary policy can do everything” "],
["Research.html", "Research", " Research Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India’s States Abstract: The magnitude of interstate trade in India adds a unique dimension to within and interstate transmission of fiscal policies. We exploit regional variations in fiscal policy to examine its local potency and spillover using a two country New Keynesian model. We find that an increase in spending generates larger domestic expansion than a reduction in excise or VAT cut. Although an increase in spending worsens home trade balance, it triggers a positive spillover on the trading partner thus contributing to regional stability. We also implement a fiscal devaluation through excise-VAT adjustments which rely on interstate trade to boost domestic output. Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization with Ayushi Bajaj Abstract: Consumer payment choice is based on heterogeneous preferences, availability, usage costs, and effective taxes. We examine the consequences of this choice on consump- tion distribution, aggregate output, welfare and the shadow economy. We employ this framework to analyze India’s unexpected demonetization of 86% of its currency in cir- culation. We find that this shock to liquidity led to an immediate and temporary fall in aggregate output and welfare. Further, it led to disparate distributional effects as not all consumers could switch to non-cash payments. Using consumption distribu- tion data, we find the lower and middle deciles in rural areas were disproportionately affected.

Mankiw, 2019 “One of the biggest challenges instructors face is avoiding the tendency to overestimate students’ knowledge and ability to absorb new information. This is sometimes called the curse of knowledge: once you know something, it is hard to remember what it is like to not know it. It is easy to unwittingly overwhelm students….Bad public policies are bad for the nation, but they are great fodder for the economics classroom.

Many of the main empirical questions in macroeconomics are the same as they have been since at least the Great Depression. What are the sources of business cycle fluctuations? How does monetary policy affect the economy? How does fiscal policy affect the economy? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Those new to our field may be tempted to ask, “How can it be that after all this time we don’t know the answers to these questions?” The reason is that identification in macroeconomics is difficult.

Controlling Rates Is More Complicated Than You Think, Stephen Williamson, St Louis Fed What is Repo Rate? Repo rate, also known as policy rate or repurchase rate, is the rate at which RBI lends money to banks. When the central bank reduces the repo rate, banks get money at a cheaper rate, and in turn, they reduce interest rates for borrowers. This is similar to the Repo rate for US Treasury and primarily a short term lending instrument with the terms of repurchase decided at the time of borrowing. RBI recently (October 1, 2019) announced a &lt;lending rate which would be linked to this repo rate, and hence makes repo rate an active interest rate which could determine credit supply in the market. What is Reverse Repo Rate? is the rate at which RBI provides interest on deposits with the RBI to commercial banks. albeit for shorter duration of deposit. How reverse repo rate became benchmark interest rate in the economy Udit Mishra, Indian Express. An important clarification is required - Reverse repo rate can only be maintained for short term, and hence it is different from Interest on Reserves for commercial banks by the Fed.
