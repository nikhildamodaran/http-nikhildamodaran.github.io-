Here is a short introduction and here’s my latest blog post. Research My research focuses on transmission of economic policy across open economies. I examine transmission in a variety of setting. I analyze regional economies which form a part of a fiscal unions in my paper “Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India’s States”, which is currently under review. I also look at transmission of fiscal policies for the Eurozone in my paper “Trade Transmission of Fiscal Policies in a Currency Union”. I am broadly interested in the effect of policy transmission for these regions especially due to their huge interdependence, which makes policy making a strategic and consequnetial exercise for these regions - in addition to its contributions to supra-regional economic performance. In similar spirit, I examine transmission of Demonetization shock on the Indian economy in a paper “Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization” in which we look at the disaggregate effects of India’s demonetization through short payment choices for consumers. This is largely regional transmission of this monetary shock.

["bio.html", "Bio Blogs and More", " Bio I completed my Ph.D. from the Department of Agricultural Economics at the Louisiana State University back in 2018. My dissertation research is on fiscal policy transmission in currency unions in which I study policy spillovers among countries in the European Monetary Union. Before graduate school at LSU, I completed M.Phil from the Center for Development Studies, Kerala, India and M.A. Economics from Center for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University. I also had a short stint in mass-communication after my undergraduate studies from Delhi University, but returned to economics without much ado. My latest CV is here. Blogs and More Latest Blog post On a Hike at Dandenong, Tremont, VIC Quotable Quotes On writing in research Thomson, W. (1999). “The process of writing itself will lead you to new knowledge. Learn to write but also write to learn.” Mike Monteiro You don’t sell a house by talking about sheetrock. You sell it by getting the buyer to picture themselves in the neighborhood. Deirde McCloskey The big secret in economics is that good writing pays well and bad writing pays badly…Rotten writing causes more papers and reports to fail than do rotten statistics or rotten research. On life, our times and existence: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen” On the origins of a central bank: “The British government has never paid off the £ 1,200,000 loan that created the Bank of England in 1694. In exchange it gave the merchants who provided the money the exclusive right to print banknotes against this debt, giving birth to the central bank and much of the architecture behind the world’s financial system.” Keynes on the profession of economics: “The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique for thinking, which helps the possessor to draw correct conclusions.” Michael Woodford on the role of fiscal policy: “Fed needs to accept the role of ‘Fiscal Policy’ instead of pushing unconventional monetary policy with the reassurance that monetary policy can do everything” "],
["Research.html", "Research", " Research Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India’s States Abstract The magnitude of interstate trade in India adds a unique dimension to within and interstate transmission of fiscal policies. We exploit regional variations in fiscal policy to examine its local potency and spillover using a two country New Keynesian model. We find that an increase in spending generates larger domestic expansion than a reduction in excise or VAT cut. Although an increase in spending worsens home trade balance, it triggers a positive spillover on the trading partner thus contributing to regional stability. We also implement a fiscal devaluation through excise-VAT adjustments which rely on interstate trade to boost domestic output. Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization with Ayushi Bajaj Abstract: Consumer payment choice is based on heterogeneous preferences, availability, usage costs, and effective taxes. We examine the consequences of this choice on consump- tion distribution, aggregate output, welfare and the shadow economy. We employ this framework to analyze India’s unexpected demonetization of 86% of its currency in cir- culation. We find that this shock to liquidity led to an immediate and temporary fall in aggregate output and welfare. Further, it led to disparate distributional effects as not all consumers could switch to non-cash payments. Using consumption distribu- tion data, we find the lower and middle deciles in rural areas were disproportionately affected.

How does monetary policy affect the economy? How does fiscal policy affect the economy? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Those new to our field may be tempted to ask, “How can it be that after all this time we don’t know the answers to these questions?” The reason is that identification in macroeconomics is difficult. &lt;a href=“10.1257/jep.32.3.59”, target=\"_blank\"&gt; Nakamura, E. and Steinsson, J.

When the central bank reduces the repo rate, banks get money at a cheaper rate, and in turn, they reduce interest rates for borrowers. This is similar to the Repo rate for US Treasury and primarily a short term lending instrument with the terms of repurchase decided at the time of borrowing.

I can only imagine the difficulty of teaching a computer screen! I enjoyed how you explained every topic with relevant real world examples, which really helped putting things in perspective. Even the assessments were exciting because of the way you structured them. For me personally, I learnt a lot from your detailed feedbacks on all the assessments highlighting even the smallest of things that can go unnoticed for very long. Thank you very much for teaching us this semester and I thoroughly enjoyed your course. I really hope you are offering electives next semester!” Kabir Aryan, JSGP, 2018. “While we were struggling to get through every deadlines, your course provided us with a structured timeline for which we could plan ahead and manage the assignments well. It helped us a lot to have enough time and mental preparedness for each macro assignment that came our way…I appreciate the time and effort you put into the course website provided. It was a great way for us to keep track of the material and extra readings for the course. Having been our first experience of online classes in college, it gave us direction and made it relatively easy for us to keep up…The best part of the macroeconomics course that you taught this semester, for me, was the individual feedback on each assignment…This feedback not only helped us improve in your course but in other courses as well. Getting such individual attention pushed us to perform better with every passing assignment.” Vidusshi Singh, JSGP, 2018.

Course Synopsis This is the second course in macroeconomics at an undergraduate level. We presume a basic knowledge of the separate markets which comprise of a general equilibrium system from the previous course. We venture into an examination of macroeconomic policy in this model to shed light contemporary real world economic issues. Can the central bank help us get out of this slump? What are its limits? Is there a role for the government? Can government spending hurt us instead? What are the textbook answers and what do we observe in real life? In the first part of the course, we then initiate an analysis of short run economic fluctuations in output using a simple macroeconomic model. We examine a simple static model with product and factor markets and build a general equilibrium model with micro-foundations. This is a version of the textbook IS-LM model. We use this model to explore Classical and Keynesian explanations of output fluctuations and the differences therein. We look at the early chronological wave of explanations for temporary fluctuations in economic activity and gradually work towards a more realistic depiction of the world. We illustrate a possible mechanism of how our economies might work and what happens after it is hit by a shock. The second part focuses on what can policymakers do after they witness this shock. We introduce two policy institutions into our model who try to precariously balance and attain a level of employment and inflation. How and why do these institutions work? We understand the logic of government policy and of governance by analyzing issues of government spending, taxation and debt which come under the ambit of fiscal policy. We also examine the objectives of central bank and its policy options in printing money and managing its balance sheet. We conclude the course by taking a snapshot of what we have missed and where new directions of research is taking the analysis of macroeconomics. What are the missing pieces of the puzzle which makes policy making challenging. Why can’t we answer old questions and why do we keep repeating our exercises to answer the same old questions in macroeconomics? Course Goals (Learning Outcomes) Participants who successfully complete the course are expected to: Build a basic model and understand its main mechanisms of transmission i.e. how macroeconomic variables are interconnected in the complex economic web, Distinguish between Classical and Keynesian interpretations of the model economy as parallel (not necessarily competing) strands of explanation, Integrate IS-LM and our basic model as two methods of formulating a model economy, Examine policy alternatives in the model and contrast it with the role of policymakers in the real world, Gain insights into functioning of the two key economic policy institutions i.e. the government and central bank, Understand common methods of policy stimulus to counteract temporary cyclical downturns and the need to do so. We will try and mix economic theories with empirical realities to understand how far can simple models explain what we as macro economists observe in any economy. At the end of this course, you should be able to start thinking like a macro economist, and even hopefully inch closer to being one. Course Materials Required Textbook: Macroeconomics, ,Andrew B.

When the central bank reduces the repo rate, banks get money at a cheaper rate, and in turn, they reduce interest rates for borrowers. This is similar to the Repo rate for US Treasury and primarily a short term lending instrument with the terms of repurchase decided at the time of borrowing.

["mathematical-methods.html", "Mathematical Methods Course Synopsis Course Goals (Learning Outcomes) Mathematics using Computers Course Materials Course Outline and Lecture Notes", " Mathematical Methods Course Synopsis This is the first part of a two-part course on mathematical methods for undergraduate students in economics. This course follows the preparatory camp which is mandatory for all students admitted into the BA. (Hons) Economics program at the School of Government and Public Policy at OP Jindal Global University. The aim of this course is to introduce the students to basic tools and techniques of mathematics that form the foundation of modern economics. Learning mathematics could be anxiety inducing for students, but we try and overcome this fear of mathematics by using it to understand economic concepts. We believe that this context helps facilitate learning of mathematics itself and align the usage of this language to economics. After taking this course, you would be able to appreciate the mathematical structure of concepts in economics and be able to identify the appropriate methods crucial for economic analysis. This course directly follows from the preparatory camp and assumes knowledge of content therein. However, we will start this course following the exposition in our core texts. We begin with a simplistic economic model. The economic variables and their relationship in the model will introduce us to concepts in sets, relations and functions. While the simple model helps us present these, we realize that the world of economics is more complicated than a single equation. It comprises of interconnections which require more description and many more equations. We use insights from the study of a system of equations to understand a complex model which such interconnections. But the world is not always linear. So even with many such equations, we fail to understand the world of economics. This brings us to the exploring non-linear equations and the world of calculus. We realize that our economic model is growing in mathematical complexity and we can understand such models by applying simple rules of calculus. We learn calculus by understanding the economics in these models and relying on the economic intuition in turn to learn calculus. We conclude this course by understanding optimal choices by agents in economics and exploring its mathematical structure.In reality, such choices are often under constraints but we leave that discussion to a follow-up course. Course Goals (Learning Outcomes) Participants who successfully complete the course are expected to: Break down an economic model into its components i.e variables, parameters and relation. They should be able to do this for all courses in economics with a mathematical structure. Understand the concept of a solution to economic models and be able to draw economic insights from the solution. Concisely write a system of linear equations in matrix notation and identify the types of matrices involved. Solve a system of matrices through the shortest possible solution and understand the equivalence of matrix solutions with solution through substitution. Understand the intuition of rates of change and be able to explain comparative statics of a model. Apply total derivatives to isolate moving parts of an economic system. Solve an unconstrained optimization and be able to make inference from the solution. We will use examples from micro and macro economics in the hope that it would facilitate you to think about the mathematics underlying other courses. At the end of this course, you should be able to get rid of your anxiety with mathematics and hopefully employ it to simplify the economics in the rest of the program. Mathematics using Computers Some of the topics could be solved using rudimentary programming using common programming languages as well as software. The course website would have more information on study material and sessions for programming. The intention of introducing this in the first semester is to again get you started with active learning and to break the monotony of online classes.
