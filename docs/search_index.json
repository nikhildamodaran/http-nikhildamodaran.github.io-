Here is a short introduction and here’s my latest blog post. Research My research focuses on transmission of economic policy across open economies. I examine transmission in a variety of setting. I analyze regional economies which form a part of a fiscal unions in my paper “Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India’s States”, which is currently under review. I also look at transmission of fiscal policies for the Eurozone in my paper “Trade Transmission of Fiscal Policies in a Currency Union”. I am broadly interested in the effect of policy transmission for these regions especially due to their huge interdependence, which makes policy making a strategic and consequnetial exercise for these regions - in addition to its contributions to supra-regional economic performance. In similar spirit, I examine transmission of Demonetization shock on the Indian economy in a paper “Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization” in which we look at the disaggregate effects of India’s demonetization through short payment choices for consumers. This is largely regional transmission of this monetary shock. Teaching I teach Macroeconomics I and II, International Trade, Mathematical Methods for Economics, Statistics II all of which are compulsary courses for BA.(Hons) Economics at O.P. Jindal Global University. Ongoing courses: EC 13: Macroeconomics II - Fall 2020 EC 01: Mathematical Methods for Economics I, Fall 2020 "]
