<p> I completed my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/agriculture/agecon/index.php"> Department of Agricultural Economics </a> at the Louisiana State University back in 2018. My dissertation research is on fiscal policy transmission in currency unions in which I study policy spillovers among countries in the European Monetary Union. Before graduate school at LSU, I completed M.Phil from the Center for Development Studies, Kerala, India and M.A. Economics from Center for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University. I also had a short stint in mass-communication after my undergraduate studies from Delhi University, but returned to economics without much ado. My latest CV is <a href="">here</a>. </p>

<h2>Quotable Quotes</h2>
<ul> 
<li> <b> On writing in research</b>: <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.37.1.157", target="_blank">Thomson, W. (1999).</a> <blockquote>"The process of writing itself will lead you to new knowledge. Learn to write but also write to learn."</blockquote> 
Mike Monteiro
<blockquote> You don't sell a house by talking about sheetrock. You sell it by getting the buyer to picture themselves in the neighborhood.</blockquote>
Deirde McCloskey
<blockquote>The big secret in economics is that good writing pays well and bad writing pays badly...Rotten writing causes more papers and reports to fail than do rotten statistics or rotten research.</blockquote>
</li>


<li><b>On life, our times and existence</b>: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin <blockquote> "There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen"</blockquote> </li>
<!--read it from The Ken newsletter on 30 April 2020, and quite appropriate to our times. -->

<!--<li> <a href="10.1257/jep.32.3.87">Jordi Gali (JEP,2018)</a> <blockquote>"It is easy to imagine the criticisms that modern macro would receive if it relied on models that were static rather than dynamic, deterministic rather than stochastic, and partial rather than general equilibrium!"</blockquote></li>-->

<li><b>    On economics, history and its squabbles</b>: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd1d35c4-7804-11ea-9840-1b8019d9a987"> On the origins of a central bank:</a><blockquote>"The British government has never paid off the &#0163; 1,200,000 loan that created the Bank of England in 1694. In exchange it gave the merchants who provided the money the exclusive right to print banknotes against this debt, giving birth to the central bank and much of the architecture behind the world's financial system."</blockquote></li> 
<!--Financial Times,  7 April 2020 -->

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/know-what-youre-protesting-economic-view.html">Keynes </a>  on the profession of economics:
<blockquote>"The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique for thinking, which helps the possessor to draw correct conclusions."</blockquote></li>

 Michael Woodford <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbmmd7TQ2Xg&feature=youtu.be"> on </a> the role of fiscal policy:
<blockquote> "Fed needs to accept the role of 'Fiscal Policy' instead of pushing unconventional monetary policy with the reassurance that monetary policy can do everything" </<blockquote></blockquote></li>
