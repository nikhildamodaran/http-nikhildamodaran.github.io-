<h2> Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India's States </h2>
<p> <b> Abstract </b>:The magnitude of interstate trade in India adds a unique dimension to within and interstate transmission of fiscal policies. We exploit regional variations in fiscal policy to examine its local potency and spillover using a two country New Keynesian model. We find that an increase in spending generates larger domestic expansion than a reduction in excise or VAT cut. Although an increase in spending worsens home trade balance, it triggers a positive spillover on the trading partner thus contributing to regional stability. We also implement a fiscal devaluation through excise-VAT adjustments which rely on interstate trade to boost domestic output. <em style="color:orangered;" > Submitted, Feb 2020 </em>

<h2> Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization </h2>
<p>with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ayushibajaj/home"> Ayushi Bajaj </a> <br>
<b> Abstract </b>:Consumer payment choice is based on heterogeneous preferences, availability, usage costs, and effective taxes. We examine the consequences of this choice on consump- tion distribution, aggregate output, welfare and the shadow economy. We employ this framework to analyze India’s unexpected demonetization of 86% of its currency in cir- culation. We find that this shock to liquidity led to an immediate and temporary fall in aggregate output and welfare. Further, it led to disparate distributional effects as not all consumers could switch to non-cash payments. Using consumption distribu- tion data, we find the lower and middle deciles in rural areas were disproportionately affected.<br>
