<div class="colapsecontent">
Welcome to Macroeconomics II course at Jindal School of Government and Public Policy! <br><br>
  
I am excited to discuss the developments in Macroeconomics, and learn more of it as we go through this course. The key to being a macroeconomist is to start doing practical macroeconomics to answer everyday questions. The more questions you raise, the more you learn. <br><br>

To begin, I recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course webapge. Review the lecture notes we intend to cover each week before I start talking about the material. Some of the discussion in the course is going to be informative. I would leave you to read and know about it on your own, so that we spend the class time developing analytical ideas about macroeconomics.<br><br>

<!--  and preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course. Click Discussions to see forums where you can discuss the course material with fellow students taking the class.-->

<!--If you have questions about course content, please post them in the forums to get help from others in the course community. For technical problems with the Coursera platform, visit the Learner Help Center.-->

Good luck as you get started, and I hope you enjoy the course!

<button class="collapsible"><h2> Course Synopsis </h2></button>
<div class="colapsecontent">
<p>

First, familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pky154wdnyphoa/Syllabus%20Macroeconomics%20II%20Fall%202020.pdf?dl=0", target="_blank">syllabus</a>. <br> <br>

This is the second course in macroeconomics at an undergraduate level. <br> <br>

We presume basic knowledge of the the goods and asset markets which comprise of a macroeconomic system from the previous macro course. <br> <br>

We formalize the interactions between these markets to examine macroeconomic policy in a model economy and shed light contemporary, real world economic issues. For instance: can the central bank help us get out of this slump? Where does the government pitch in to support the central bank? or Should the resurgence be spearheaded by the government? Can government intervention hurt us instead? <br> <br>

We study the textbook answers and contrast it with what we observe in real life.<br> <br>

<b> First part of the course </b> : In the first part of the course, we then initiate an analysis of short run economic fluctuations in output using a simple macroeconomic model. We examine a simple static model with product and factor markets and build a general equilibrium model with micro-foundations. <br> <br>

This is a version of the textbook IS-LM model. We use this model to explore Classical and Keynesian explanations of output fluctuations and the differences therein. We look at the early chronological wave of explanations for temporary fluctuations in economic activity and gradually work towards a more realistic depiction of the world. We illustrate a \textit{possible mechanism} of how our economies might work and what happens after it is hit by a shock.<br> <br>

<b> Second part of the course</b>: The second part focuses on what can policymakers do after they witness this shock. <br> <br>

We introduce two policy institutions into our model who try to precariously balance and attain a level of employment and inflation. How and why do these institutions work? We understand the logic of government policy and of governance by analyzing issues of government spending, taxation and debt which come under the ambit of fiscal policy. We also examine the objectives of central bank and its policy options in printing money and managing its balance sheet. <br> <br>

<b> Hits and Misses</b>: We conclude the course by taking a snapshot of what we have missed and where new directions of research is taking the analysis of macroeconomics. What are the missing pieces of the puzzle which makes policy making challenging. Why can't we answer old questions and why do we keep repeating our exercises to answer the same old questions in macroeconomics? <br> <br>
</p>

<button class="collapsible-sub"><h3> Course Goals</h3></button>
<div class="colapsecontent-sub">
<p> Participants who successfully complete the course are expected to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Build a basic model and understand its main mechanisms of transmission i.e. how macroeconomic variables are interconnected in the complex economic web, </li>
    <li> Integrate our model into a textbook IS-LM model.</li>
    <li> Imagine new ideas of integrating observations about the macro-economy into our model economy,</li>
    <li> Embed the role of policy-makers in the model economy and re-evaluate the model,</li>
    <li> Examine policy alternatives in the model and contrast it with the role of policymakers in the real world,</li>
    <li> Understand common methods of policy stimulus to counteract temporary cyclical downturns.</li>
</ol>
<p> We will try and mix economic theories with empirical realities to understand how far can simple models explain what we as macro economists observe in any economy. At the end of this course, you should be able to start thinking like a macro economist, and even hopefully inch closer to being one.</p>

<q> Many of the main empirical questions in macroeconomics are the same as they have been since at least the Great Depression. What are the sources of business cycle fluctuations? How does monetary policy affect the economy? How does fiscal policy affect the economy? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Those new to our field may be tempted to ask, “How can it be that after all this time we don’t know the answers to these questions?” The reason is that identification in macroeconomics is difficult.</q>

<li> <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/what-is/repo-rate-meaning/1748807/", target="_blank" > What is Repo Rate? </a>: Repo rate, also known as policy rate or repurchase rate, is the rate at which RBI lends money to banks. When the central bank reduces the repo rate, banks get money at a cheaper rate, and in turn, they reduce interest rates for borrowers. This is similar to the Repo rate for US Treasury and primarily a short term lending instrument with the terms of repurchase decided at the time of borrowing. <br>

<h2> Student Responses from the Course</h2>
<p style="text-align: left"> "I really enjoyed learning from you and thank you for being patient with us this entire semester. I can only imagine the difficulty of teaching a computer screen! I enjoyed how you explained every topic with relevant real world examples, which really helped putting things in perspective. Even the assessments were exciting because of the way you structured them. For me personally, I learnt a lot from your detailed feedbacks on all the assessments highlighting even the smallest of things that can go unnoticed for very long. Thank you very much for teaching us this semester and I thoroughly enjoyed your course. I really hope you are offering electives next semester! " Kabir Aryan, JSGP, 2018.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: left">
"While we were struggling to get through every deadlines, your course provided us with a structured timeline for which we could plan ahead and manage the assignments well. It helped us a lot to have enough time and mental preparedness for each macro assignment that came our way...I appreciate the time and effort you put into the course website provided. It was a great way for us to keep track of the material and extra readings for the course. Having been our first experience of online classes in college, it gave us direction and made it relatively easy for us to keep up...The best part of the macroeconomics course that you taught this semester, for me, was the individual feedback on each assignment...This feedback not only helped us improve in your course but in other courses as well. Getting such individual attention pushed us to perform better with every passing assignment." Vidusshi Singh, JSGP, 2018.

<h2> Course Synopsis </h2>
<p style="text-align: left">
This is the second course in macroeconomics at an undergraduate level. We presume a basic knowledge of the separate markets which comprise of a general equilibrium system from the previous course. We venture into an examination of macroeconomic policy in this model to shed light contemporary real world economic issues. Can the central bank help us get out of this slump? What are its limits? Is there a role for the government? Can government spending hurt us instead? What are the textbook answers and what do we observe in real life?<br> <br>
In the first part of the course, we then initiate an analysis of short run economic fluctuations in output using a simple macroeconomic model. We examine a simple static model with product and factor markets and build a general equilibrium model with micro-foundations. This is a version of the textbook IS-LM model. We use this model to explore Classical and Keynesian explanations of output fluctuations and the differences therein. We look at the early chronological wave of explanations for temporary fluctuations in economic activity and gradually work towards a more realistic depiction of the world. We illustrate a possible mechanism of how our economies might work and what happens after it is hit by a shock.<br> <br>
The second part focuses on what can policymakers do after they witness this shock. We introduce two policy institutions into our model who try to precariously balance and attain a level of employment and inflation. How and why do these institutions work? We understand the logic of government policy and of governance by analyzing issues of government spending, taxation and debt which come under the ambit of fiscal policy. We also examine the objectives of central bank and its policy options in printing money and managing its balance sheet.<br> <br>
We conclude the course by taking a snapshot of what we have missed and where new directions of research is taking the analysis of macroeconomics. What are the missing pieces of the puzzle which makes policy making challenging. Why can't we answer old questions and why do we keep repeating our exercises to answer the same old questions in macroeconomics?<br> <br>
</p>

<h3> Course Goals (Learning Outcomes)</h3>
<p> Participants who successfully complete the course are expected to:
</p>
<ol >
<li> Build a basic model and understand its main mechanisms of transmission i.e. how macroeconomic variables are interconnected in the complex economic web,</li>
<li> Distinguish between Classical and Keynesian interpretations of the model economy as parallel (not necessarily competing) strands of explanation, </li>
<li> Integrate IS-LM and our basic model as two methods of formulating a model economy,</li>
<li> Examine policy alternatives in the model and contrast it with the role of policymakers in the real world,</li>
<li> Gain insights into functioning of the two key economic policy institutions i.e. the government and central bank,</li>
<li> Understand common methods of policy stimulus to counteract temporary cyclical downturns and the need to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p> We will try and mix economic theories with empirical realities to understand how far can simple models explain what we as macro economists observe in any economy. At the end of this course, you should be able to start thinking like a macro economist, and even hopefully inch closer to being one.</p><br>

<li> <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/what-is/repo-rate-meaning/1748807/", target="_blank" > What is Repo Rate? </a>: Repo rate, also known as policy rate or repurchase rate, is the rate at which RBI lends money to banks. When the central bank reduces the repo rate, banks get money at a cheaper rate, and in turn, they reduce interest rates for borrowers. This is similar to the Repo rate for US Treasury and primarily a short term lending instrument with the terms of repurchase decided at the time of borrowing. <br>
RBI recently (October 1, 2019) announced a <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/what-is/repo-linked-lending-rate-rllr-meaning/1715264/", target="_blank"> lending rate which would be linked to this repo rate</a>, and hence makes repo rate an active interest rate which could determine credit supply in the market. </li>
