<h2> Course Synopsis </h2>
<p>  
This is the first course in macroeconomics at an undergraduate level. It will enable you to understand the structure, operation and functioning of the larger parts of an economy by focusing on the behavior of economic ‘aggregates’, also called macroeconomic variables. It outlines an economic framework which will be one distinct way of looking at the larger macroeconomy. We develop economic intuition behiend comovements of macroeconomic variables. For instance, why does increase in GDP often accompany a decrease in unemployment? How could GDP increase without a decrease in unemployment? We will also read news articles which inform us of recent trends in macroeconomic data and validate our theory. This course can be attended by anyone who had completed high school and is delivered at the School of Government and Public Policy, OP Jindal Global Univeristy in Fall. <br><br>

In the first part of the course we will first understand the data which describes a macroeconomy - what do we mean by GDP, how do we measure unemployment, which interest rate do we talk about when we refer to monetary policy etc. We also distinguish between data used for short term analysis of the economy versus data used to examine its long term trends. After understanding the measures, we look at the markets whcih comprise of our macroeconomy, first by unpacking the factor and the asset markets. How does our productivity affect our GDP? Does it also affect unemployment? The factor market decides how much we earn as workers and how much we gain as owners of capital. What do we do with it? This crucially determines our involvement in the asset market, which becomes our next stop. <br><br>

We have crucially left our involvement in the goods market to the second part of the course. In this part we spend some time understanding consumption, and linking it back to our decisions in the goods as well as asset markets. In realtiy, we decide our participation in all these markets simultaneously, so our decisions in one will affect our strategies in others. If we wish to consumer more, we could supply more hours of labor now, get skilled by spenidng less time working now but gaining crucial eductation to earn more in the future. If we wish to consume more when we are old, we might also want to save up more, or revisit our savings strategies which directly affect the asset market. In the second part of the course, we will look at the motivation of deciding our consumption as well as its implication on these seemingly disparate markets. <br><br>

We move along the course by zooming out, and putting it all together in a simple model of macroeconomy. This is just a first pass and one could think of this as a way of simplifying the world around us. It is not a defiinitive statement of how the economy actually functions. We conclude by magnifying our perspective to think about long run growth of a macroeconomy. Since this is a first course in macroeconomics, we will not be toucing upon crucial aspects of policy, aspects of macroeconomic interactions with other economies and recent debates about old theories, new theories and our wonderment of reality. <br><br>

We will follow the adventures of two economies - India and the United States to understand key economic outcomes which define the state of these economies and explain their evolution. Since this is the first course at an undergraduate level, we will build small theories from the ground up and evaluate how these theories help explain various macroeconomic variables. We do not seek to become macroeconomists in one semester, but we will learn to look at places where a macroeconomist looks - under the hood of the economy.
</p>
<br><br>


<h3> Course Goals (Learning Outcomes)</h3>
<p> Participants who successfully complete the course are expected to: </p>
<ul>
<li> Understand the basic national income accounting, familiarize with measurement macroeconomic variables such as the Gross Domestic Production, Inflation, Unemployment, Interest Rate etc. as well as the visual representation and inference of such data. </li>
<li> Explain clearly individual decisions which affect labor supply decisions and contribute towards an explanation of unemployment.</li>
<li> Examine the choice of savings for an individual and its consequences on the asset market interest rate.</li>
<li> Elucidate aspects of consumption which showcase the macroeconomic linkages of an individual's optimal consumption decision, and place it in context of our evolving understanding of consumption.</li>
<li> Use functioning of these seemingly disparate markets to explain their interactions and the resultant macroeconomic outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p> We will try and mix economic theories with empirical realities to understand how far can simple models explain what we as macroeconomists observe in any economy. At the end of this course, you should be able to start thinking like a macroeconomist, and even hopefully inch closer to being one. </p><br><br>

He writes: "In many ways, discussing macroeconomics with friends and relatives is like discussing primary education, evolution, religion, or human sexuality – everyone has an opinion, everyone thinks their opinion is right, many people are stubborn about their opinions, and – while most of the opinions are worthwhile – many of them have no foundation whatsoever. They may even know that their viewpoints are incorrect, but they are too wedded to them to change – a psychological condition known as cognitive dissonance." </li>
