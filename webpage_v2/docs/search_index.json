Here is a short introduction and here’s my latest blog post. Research My research focuses on transmission of economic policy across open economies. I examine transmission in a variety of setting. I analyze regional economies which form a part of a fiscal unions in my paper “Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India’s States”, which is currently under review. I also look at transmission of fiscal policies for the Eurozone in my paper “Trade Transmission of Fiscal Policies in a Currency Union”. I am broadly interested in the effect of policy transmission for these regions especially due to their huge interdependence, which makes policy making a strategic and consequnetial exercise for these regions - in addition to its contributions to supra-regional economic performance. In similar spirit, I examine transmission of Demonetization shock on the Indian economy in a paper “Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization” in which we look at the disaggregate effects of India’s demonetization through short payment choices for consumers. This is largely regional transmission of this monetary shock.

["bio.html", "Bio", " Bio I completed my Ph.D. from the Department of Agricultural Economics at the Louisiana State University back in 2018. My dissertation research is on fiscal policy transmission in currency unions in which I study policy spillovers among countries in the European Monetary Union. Before graduate school at LSU, I completed M.Phil from the Center for Development Studies, Kerala, India and M.A. Economics from Center for Economic Studies and Planning, Jawaharlal Nehru University. I also had a short stint in mass-communication after my undergraduate studies from Delhi University, but returned to economics without much ado. My latest CV is here. Blogs and More Latest Blog post On a Hike at Dandenong, Tremont, VIC Quotable Quotes On writing in research Thomson, W. (1999). “The process of writing itself will lead you to new knowledge. Learn to write but also write to learn.” Mike Monteiro You don’t sell a house by talking about sheetrock. You sell it by getting the buyer to picture themselves in the neighborhood. Deirde McCloskey The big secret in economics is that good writing pays well and bad writing pays badly…Rotten writing causes more papers and reports to fail than do rotten statistics or rotten research. On life, our times and existence: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen” On the origins of a central bank: “The British government has never paid off the £ 1,200,000 loan that created the Bank of England in 1694. In exchange it gave the merchants who provided the money the exclusive right to print banknotes against this debt, giving birth to the central bank and much of the architecture behind the world’s financial system.” Keynes on the profession of economics: “The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique for thinking, which helps the possessor to draw correct conclusions.” Michael Woodford on the role of fiscal policy: “Fed needs to accept the role of ‘Fiscal Policy’ instead of pushing unconventional monetary policy with the reassurance that monetary policy can do everything” "],
["Research.html", "Research", " Research Fiscal Policy and Transmission: The Case of India’s States Abstract: The magnitude of interstate trade in India adds a unique dimension to within and interstate transmission of fiscal policies. We exploit regional variations in fiscal policy to examine its local potency and spillover using a two country New Keynesian model. We find that an increase in spending generates larger domestic expansion than a reduction in excise or VAT cut. Although an increase in spending worsens home trade balance, it triggers a positive spillover on the trading partner thus contributing to regional stability. We also implement a fiscal devaluation through excise-VAT adjustments which rely on interstate trade to boost domestic output. Consumer Payment Choice and the Heterogeneous Impact of India’s Demonetization with Ayushi Bajaj Abstract: Consumer payment choice is based on heterogeneous preferences, availability, usage costs, and effective taxes. We examine the consequences of this choice on consump- tion distribution, aggregate output, welfare and the shadow economy. We employ this framework to analyze India’s unexpected demonetization of 86% of its currency in cir- culation. We find that this shock to liquidity led to an immediate and temporary fall in aggregate output and welfare. Further, it led to disparate distributional effects as not all consumers could switch to non-cash payments. Using consumption distribu- tion data, we find the lower and middle deciles in rural areas were disproportionately affected.

Many of the main empirical questions in macroeconomics are the same as they have been since at least the Great Depression. What are the sources of business cycle fluctuations? How does monetary policy affect the economy? How does fiscal policy affect the economy? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Those new to our field may be tempted to ask, “How can it be that after all this time we don’t know the answers to these questions?” The reason is that identification in macroeconomics is difficult.

Controlling Rates Is More Complicated Than You Think, Stephen Williamson, St Louis Fed What is Repo Rate? Repo rate, also known as policy rate or repurchase rate, is the rate at which RBI lends money to banks. When the central bank reduces the repo rate, banks get money at a cheaper rate, and in turn, they reduce interest rates for borrowers. This is similar to the Repo rate for US Treasury and primarily a short term lending instrument with the terms of repurchase decided at the time of borrowing. RBI recently (October 1, 2019) announced a &lt;lending rate which would be linked to this repo rate, and hence makes repo rate an active interest rate which could determine credit supply in the market. What is Reverse Repo Rate? is the rate at which RBI provides interest on deposits with the RBI to commercial banks. albeit for shorter duration of deposit. How reverse repo rate became benchmark interest rate in the economy Udit Mishra, Indian Express. An important clarification is required - Reverse repo rate can only be maintained for short term, and hence it is different from Interest on Reserves for commercial banks by the Fed.

["maths.html", "Mathematical Methods for Economics I", " Mathematical Methods for Economics I Lecture Notes Fall 2020, Syllabus Topic 1: Basic Tools of Mathematical Economics Lec 01: Introduction to Mathematical Economics Lec 02: Mathematical Models in Economics Lec 03: Introduction to Set Theory Lec 04: Relations, Functions and Economics An example of a rational function used in class is \\[y = \\frac{x^{2} +3}{5x + 7}\\] While it is easier to imagine the shape of common mathematical functions in economics, it might get harder. For functions such as this, we rely on computer to give us an idea about its shape. For instance, we can simulate the shape of this function for 25 values of \\(x \\in [-10, 10]\\) to obtain the following: What happens to this function when we get more values of \\(x\\) in the same range? Thus the computer can only help us approximate the shape of the function based on the kind of questions we ask. In order to inform ourselves about the shape, we can rely on the principles of differentiation which would be explored later in the course. Remember that we used a linear total cost function to understand the application of linear functions in economics. This cost function is peculiar. One example is as follows: For a linear cost function we have a linear total variable cost too. Further, even our average variable cost is linear and more so horizontal as follows: But for a linear total cost function, our average fixed cost is actually a hyperbola of the following form: Notice that in economics we will use a variety of rectangular and regular hyperbolas, esp. in microeconomics.

["understanding-is-lm-model-analytically.html", "Understanding IS-LM Model Analytically 0.1 Introduction 0.2 Labor Market Equilibrium", " Understanding IS-LM Model Analytically 0.1 Introduction After a preview of AD-AS we move onto a bit more detailed model using IS-LM. Note that the AD-AS model gave us \\((P,Y)\\) ordered pair in which \\(P\\) is the price which clears the goods market and \\(Y\\) is the level of output at which aggregate demand equals aggregate supply. In order to understand the model you need to understand three markets - the labor market, the goods market and the asset market and their interaction. Each market in turn requires you to focus on: The demand and supply forces in these markets. Their equilibrium condition which is when demand in these markets eqates with their supplies. The resultant ordered pair of (price, quantity) in each of these markets. 0.2 Labor Market Equilibrium Consumers supply labor while firms demand labor. Operate under perfectly competitive markets i.e. do not have the power to set prices (wages) in the market or supply output which could drive down prices. Labor Demand is obtained by profit maximizing producers choosing how much to produce based on the following production funciton: \\[ y = f(N,K, A, X&#39;_{s}) + \\varepsilon_{s}, \\] where \\(y\\) is the output produced, \\(N\\) is the labor supply, \\(K\\) is the capital required, \\(A\\) is a metric of productivity and \\(X_{s}&#39;\\) are other factors which could potentially affect production function. We ignore \\(\\varepsilon_{s}\\) unobserved factors which affect business cycle movements in production for the remaining analysis. Production function under the assumption that capital or other factors are not constrained and \\[\\begin{gather} y = A \\Big( \\gamma_1 N - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_2 N^2 \\Big)\\Bigg|_{K \\; \\text{constant}} \\end{gather}\\] Notice that this is essentially a function of one variable \\(y=f(N)\\) with parameters i.e. \\(A, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2\\). Recall the profit maximization problem from Micro courses. We have two questions to answer How is the profit maximization problem affect the level of labor employed by firms? How does the marginal product of labor help us analyze the firm’s choice? Marginal productivity of Labor (MPL) is the partial derivative of output on labor i.e. \\[ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial N} = A \\Big( \\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2 N \\Big) \\] Interpretation: The Marginal Product of Labor (MPL) determines the additional output produced by additional labor employed, and helps firms decide how much labor hours should it hire to remain profitable. Given this marginal product, under perfect competition we obtain the following condition \\[ w = \\text{MPL} = A \\Big( \\gamma_1 - \\gamma_2 N \\Big) \\] Rearranging this gives us labor demand as a function of real wage: \\[ N = \\overbrace{\\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\gamma_2}}^{intercept} - \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{A \\gamma_2}}_{slope} w \\] This is only labor demand and does not complete the market equilibirum. Labor supply on the other hand is determined by consumers who are also suppliers of labor. 0.2.1 Ad-Hoc Labor Supply Let us assume a linear upward sloping labor supply of the following form: \\[ N = \\underbrace{n_{0}}_{\\text{intercept}} + \\overbrace{n_1 (1-t)}^{\\text{slope}} w \\] Notice that the slope is variable here and depends upon the rate of taxation . Does this make sense to you? Lets understand how the rate of taxation affects labor supply decision. Consider two types of individuals. The rich gets taxed at 40% i.e. \\(t_r = 0.40\\) while the poor gets taxed at 15% i.e. \\(t_p = 0.15\\). Let us assume that \\(n_1\\) for both is identical and is 1. Let us assume \\(n_0 = 6\\) for both and only tax rates differ for them. Which individual responds more to wages and why? # simulating 100 values of wages from 0 to 1 w = seq(0,1, length = 100) n_0 = 6 n_1 = 1 t_p = 0.15 t_r = 0.40 Np = n_0 + n_1 * (1-0.15) * w Nr = n_0 + n_1 * (1-0.40) * w # Rich individual&#39;s slope is flatter. plot( w, Nr, type = &quot;l&quot;, main = &quot;Comparing Two Tax Rates and Labor Supply&quot;) # Poor individual&#39;s slope is steeper lines( w, Np, col = &quot;red&quot;) Once we have both labor demand and supply, we can obtain the labor market equilibrum as a pair of price, output i.e. \\((N, w)\\) so that labor demanded by the firm exactly equals labor supplied by the consumers. When both are acting optimally on their own accord the equilibrium implies the following equality \\[ \\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\gamma_2} - \\frac{1}{A \\gamma_2} w \\equiv n_{0} + n_1 (1-t) w \\] This implies the following equilibrium wage: \\[ w = \\frac{A (\\gamma_1 - n_0 \\gamma_2)}{A \\gamma_2 n_2 (1-t) + 1} \\] Equilibrium price for the labor market is thus dependent upon the model paramters and we can understand how equilibrium wage changes when any of these variables change. Equilibrium output can be obtained by substituting the above in either labor demand or labor supply to obtain \\[ N = \\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)}\\] We can also understand this equilibirum graphically using our labor supply and following labor demand: # generating random wage numbers w = seq(0,1, length = 100) # parameter values gamma1 = 2 gamma2 = 0.5 A = 3 n_0 = 6 n_1 = 1 t = 0.35 # labor demand equation Nd = (gamma1/gamma2) - (1/(A*gamma2)) * w # labor supply equation Ns = n_0 + n_1 * (1-t) * w # examining equilibrium graphically plot( w, Nd, type = &quot;l&quot;, main = &quot;Graphical Analysis of Labor Market Equilibrium&quot;) abline( w, Ns, col = &quot;red&quot;) Connecting Labor and Goods Market(s) There are two interactions between goods and labor markets. Consumer earns wages in labor market and buys goods in the goods market. Firm produces goods in the goods market with the labor it hired in the labor market. We can use either of these linkages to go to the goods market and evaluate its status. We use the second. When we substitute employment obtained previously in the production function, we get the total production in the goods market. \\[ y = A \\Big( \\gamma_1 N - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_2 N^2 \\Big) \\] \\[N = \\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\] \\[Y_{FE} = A \\Bigg[ \\gamma_1 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg) - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_2 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg)^2 \\Bigg]\\] Using the above expression for our parameter values we can obtain the full employment equilibrium as # parameter values gamma1 = 2 gamma2 = 0.5 A = 3 n0 = 6 n1 = 1 t = 0.35 Y = A * ( gamma1 * ((n0 + n1 * gamma1 * A * (1-t)) /(1+n1 * gamma2 * A * (1-t))) - (1/2) * gamma2 * ((n0 + n1 * gamma1 * A * (1-t))/ (1+n1 * gamma2 * A * (1-t)))^2) Y # our full employment output for given parameter values ## [1] 11.23089 Plotting full employment output and examining the effect of change in parameters i = seq(0,10, length = 100) Y = A * ( gamma1 * ((n0 + n1 * gamma1 * A * (1-t))/ (1+n1 * gamma2 * A * (1-t))) - (1/2) * gamma2 * ((n0 + n1 * gamma1 * A * (1-t))/ (1+n1 * gamma2 * A * (1-t)))^2) + 0*i plot(Y,i, type = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;Equilibrium Output&quot;, ylab = &quot;Real Interest Rate&quot;, ylim = c(1,8)) abline(h=0, col=&quot;blue&quot;) Use the discussion in text chapter 9 to understand effect of an increase in productivity on full employment output.

We have the full employment aggregate supply by firms so that \\(Y^* = Y_{FE}\\) In order to understand the goods market equilibirum, we start with the main components of aggregate demand in a closed economy. \\[Y = C^d + I^d + G \\] \\(C^d\\) is the desired consumption demand by individuals in an economy. We assume that a maximixing agent chooses consumption and labor supply such that his resultant consumption demand looks like the following: \\[C^d = c_0 + c_y (Y-T) - c_r r ,\\] where \\(c_0 &gt; 0, c_y \\in (0,1)\\) and \\(c_r \\geq 0\\) are parameters representing intercept, marginal propensity to consume and marginal propensity to consume based on rate of interest changes respectively. (Y - T) is disposable income and \\(r\\) is the real interest rate. Consumption Function c0 = 50 cy = 0.6 T = 20 cr = 0.2 r = seq(0,10, length = 100) Y = seq(-50, 500, length = 100) C = c0 + cy * ( Y-T) - cr * r plot(Y,C, type = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;Output&quot;, ylab = &quot;Consumption&quot;, ylim = c(-5,400), xlim = c(-5,400), main = &quot;Aggregate Consumption Function&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;) abline(v = 0, h=0, col=&quot;black&quot;) T, denotes total tax revenue obtained from consumers, out of which a part is lumpsum taxes \\(t_0\\) and the remaining depends on a consumer’s income such that: \\[ T = t_0 + tY \\] Investment Function \\(I^d\\) is the desired investment similar to desired consumption. Similar to taxes, investment is assumed to have a lumpsum component as well as a component which responds to rate of interest such that: \\[ I^d = i_0 + i_r r ,\\] where \\(i_0,i_r &gt; 0\\). Why do we call \\(I^d\\) and \\(C^d\\) desired investment and consumption? Finally, \\(G\\) is assumed to be government spending exogenous i.e. we do not explicitly specify G and treat it as a parameter. We can simplify the expression of demand by substituting the definitions of \\(C^d, I^d\\) and \\(G\\) to obtain \\[ Y = \\frac{c_0 + c_y t_0 + i_0 + G}{1-c_y (1-t)} - \\frac{c_r + i_r}{1-c_y (1-t)} r \\] This is the analytical expression for IS curve in which savings equals investment which implies \\(Y = C^d + I^d + G\\). We can write the expression as: \\[ Y = \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 r,\\] \\[\\text{where}\\; \\beta_0 = \\frac{c_0 + c_y t_0 + i_0 + G}{1-c_y (1-t)} \\] \\[\\beta_1 = \\frac{c_r + i_r}{1-c_y (1-t)} \\] Infering from a goods market equilibrium tells us (a) it is linear in (Y,r) space and (b) has a slope \\(\\beta_1\\) and intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) c0 = 50 cy = 0.6 i0 = 30 G = 20 t0 = 5 t = 0.35 cr = 0.2 ir = 0.4 beta0 = (c0 + cy* t0 + i0 + G)/(1-cy *(1-t)) beta1 = (cr + ir)/(1-cy * (1-t)) r = seq(0,10, length = 100) Y = beta0 - beta1 * r plot(Y, r, type = &quot;l&quot;, xlab = &quot;Output&quot;, ylab = &quot;Real interest rate&quot;, ylim = c(-2,10), main = &quot;IS Curve&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;) Regression and Goods Market Equilibrium We obtain goods market equilibirum which represents the following structure: \\[ y = \\beta_{0}^{IS} + \\beta_{1}^{IS} r \\] Mathematically, what does this tell you? (Hint: Think about the functional form) Can you infer the responsiveness of interest rate on output from this expression? We regress GDP (\\(y\\)) on real interest rate (\\(r\\)) with a constant. We obtain \\(\\hat{\\beta_{0}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_{1}}\\). Do you think these would represent \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) shown analytically above? No, because \\(r\\) is influenced by factors in the money market, so what appears as the causal impact of \\(r\\) on \\(y\\) is partly influenced by interactions in the money market too. So regressing \\(y\\) on \\(r\\) would provide you a biased estimate of \\(\\beta_1^{IS}\\). Theory : To complete the picture of our model economy, we venture into the third market. Asset Market Equilibirum in a Macroeconomic Model Recap : We have discussed the demand and supply in two markets. Similarly the demand and supply in money market should be identified in order to understand its equilibirum. Note : ABC uses a convention of talking about asset markets in general. That is a broader approach and should be followed. Money Demand (Real) : is represented by the following relation: \\[ \\frac{M^d}{P} = l_{0} + l_y Y - l_r (r+\\pi^e),\\] where \\(M^d\\) is the nominal money demand, \\(P\\) is a price index, \\(l_0, l_y, l_r &gt;0\\) are parameters, \\(\\pi^e\\) is the expected inflation rate. Notice that \\(l_0\\) is the demand for money which is not dependent upon income or interest rate. It could be concieved as minimum transactions demand. \\(l_y\\) measures the responsiveness of money demand to output and \\(l_r\\) to nominal rate of interest. Notice that Fisher’s Rule gives us the relation between nominal and real interest rate which is used here. Money Supply : is according to what we call the Taylor’s rule. It implies controlling money such that the equilibrium real interest rate is within the bounds decided by the RBI. Let us assume the equilibirum rate of interest is within these bounds such that money supply is given by \\(M^s\\). Equilibirum in the money market implies: \\[ \\frac{M^s}{P} \\equiv l_{0} + l_y Y - l_r (r+\\pi^e)\\] Notice here that we have additional parameters- \\(M,\\pi^e\\) for the model which feature just like \\(A\\), or \\(G\\) previously. Another important thing to notice is that these are differet from \\(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, n_0, n_1, c_0, c_y, c_r, t_0, t, i_0, i_r\\) and now \\(l_0, l_y, l_r\\). Why? Simplifying equilibrium implies a relation between output and real interest rate depicting the LM curve of the form: \\[ Y = \\frac{M P^{-1} + l_0 + l_r \\pi^e}{l_y} + \\frac{l_r}{l_y} r \\] Mathematically, structure is similar to the IS-curve and could be represented as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y &amp;= \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 r, \\\\ \\beta_2 &amp;= \\frac{M P^{-1} + l_0 + l_r \\pi^e}{l_y} \\\\ \\beta_3 &amp;= \\frac{l_r}{l_y} \\end{aligned} \\] Read chapter 9 and understand the factors which shift LM curve contained in \\(\\beta_2\\) and the factors which cause a movement along an existing curve. Practice Question Q1. We work through the labor market for this question. Consider the following production function \\[ Y = A L^\\alpha K^\\beta \\] Notice that even though there is capital in the production function, we assume that the firm does not get constrained by capital. (Hint: You can assume it to be a parameter just like \\(A\\).) What is the expression for labor demand for this economy? Labor demand is obtained by first finding out the marginal productivity of labor and then equating it with the real wages faced by producer. Producer: cannot set real wages as he is in perfectly competitive market \\[ \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial L} = A \\alpha L^{\\alpha-1}K^{\\beta} = w \\] Rearraning we get: \\[ L = \\bigg( \\frac{w}{\\alpha A K^{\\beta}}\\bigg)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1}} \\] Correct option was (c) \\[ L = \\frac{\\alpha K^\\beta A}{w L^{\\alpha-1}}\\] \\[ L = \\frac{w \\alpha K^\\beta A}{L^{\\alpha-1}}\\] \\[ L = \\bigg(\\frac{w}{\\alpha K^\\beta A}\\bigg)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1}}\\] \\[ L = \\bigg(\\frac{w}{K^\\beta A}\\bigg)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1}}\\] Q2. Now assume that the labor supply by consumers in this economy is of the following form: \\[ L = \\Big[ K^{-\\beta} n_0 + n_1 (1-t) w K^{-\\beta} \\Big]^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}} \\] In equilibrium for the labor market, you know that the demand for labor by firms is exactly met my the supply of such labor by these consumers. Notice that consumers are also owners of capital. The amount of capital they own affects their labor supply. How does it affect a consumer’s labor supply and which could be the associated reasons? Slight re-write implies the following form: \\[ L = K^{\\frac{-\\beta}{\\alpha - 1}} \\Big[ n_0 + n_1 (1-t) w \\Big]^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}} \\] - Note that \\(1 &gt; \\beta &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\) implies that \\(K^{\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\alpha} &gt; 0}\\). Thus when K increases, L also increases. The correct answer is (a). And the practice quiz answer was incorrect. The reasoning could be one of the many reasons you can think of, but the relation is obtained from mathematical formaulation. If a consumer owns more capital, he supplies more labor because he wants to use his capital. If a consumer owns more capital, he supplies less labor because he prefers leisure over labor. If a consumer owns more capital, he supplies less labor because he earns rents from owning the capital. If a consumer owns more capital, he supplies more labor because his real wages are more than the rents on capital. Q3. With the labor demand corresponding to the following production function \\[ Y = A L^\\alpha K^\\beta \\] And the labor supply corresponding to the following: \\[ L = \\Big[ K^{-\\beta} n_0 + n_1 (1-t) w K^{-\\beta} \\Big]^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}} \\] What is the equilibrium real wage for this model economy? From earlier \\(L = \\Big( \\frac{w}{\\alpha A K^{\\beta}} \\Big)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1}}\\) from labor demand and above labor supply, we equate the RHS to obtain \\[ w = \\frac{\\alpha A n_0}{1-\\alpha n_1 A (1-t)} \\] Option (a) was correct. \\[ w = \\frac{\\alpha A n_0}{1-n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A} \\] \\[ w = \\frac{\\alpha}{1-n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A} \\] \\[ w = \\frac{\\alpha A n_0}{1-n_1 (1-t) A} \\] \\[ w = \\frac{1-n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A}{\\alpha A n_0} \\] Q4. With the labor demand corresponding to the following production function \\[ Y = A L^\\alpha K^\\beta \\] with an equilibrium employment as follows: \\[ L = \\bigg[ \\frac{n_0}{K^\\beta \\big[ 1 - n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A \\big]} \\bigg]^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1}} \\] What is the full employment equilibirum output? Simple careful substitution would give you the following answer. Note that the quiz again had incorrect equilibrium employment which led to incorrect full employment output. The correct answer is: \\[ Y = \\frac{A n_0^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha - 1}}}{ \\Big[ 1-\\alpha n_1 A (1-t)\\Big]^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha - 1}}} K^{\\frac{\\beta (\\alpha - 2)}{\\alpha-1}} \\] Check and let me know if there is any error. Your options were the following and none of which was correct. For future quizzes, you would get double the points if you point out algebraic errors. \\[ Y_{FE} = \\frac{A n_0^{1-\\alpha}}{K^\\alpha \\Big[ 1 - n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A \\Big]}\\] \\[ Y_{FE} = \\frac{A n_0^{\\alpha}}{K^{\\alpha - 1} \\Big[ 1 - n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A \\Big]}\\] \\[ Y_{FE} = \\frac{A n_0^{\\alpha}}{K^\\alpha \\Big[ 1 - n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A \\Big]}\\] \\[ Y_{FE} = \\frac{A n_0^{1-\\alpha}}{K^{\\alpha-1} \\Big[ 1 - n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A \\Big]}\\] Q5. Consider the following model economy with a production function \\[ Y = A L^\\alpha K^\\beta \\] an equilibrium employment: \\[ L = \\bigg[ \\frac{n_0}{K^\\beta \\big[ 1 - n_1 (1-t) \\alpha A \\big]} \\bigg]^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha - 1}}\\] Assume the following parameter values and evaluate the full employment output for this economy. \\[ n_0 = A = \\alpha = 1\\] \\[K = 2\\] \\[t = 0.5\\] \\[n_1 = 0.5\\] # specify the parameter values in R n0 = 1 A = 1 alpha = 0.3 K = 2 t = 0.5 n1 = 0.2 beta = 1 How am I solving this? Simply telling R to calculate Y_fe for these parameter values using the following code: # write the expression in R Yfe = (A * n0^(alpha/(alpha-1)) * K^(beta*(alpha-2)/(alpha-1))) / (1 - alpha * n1 * A * (1-t))^(alpha/(alpha-1)) # remember to put brackets properly cat(c(&quot;Your full employment output is &quot;, Yfe)) ## Your full employment output is 5.31378024460662 All the options which followed were incorrect due to mistake in equilibrium employment. Again, its best to check your calculations (even for an instructor!!) \\(Y_{FE} = 0.50\\) \\(Y_{FE} = 0.66\\) \\(Y_{FE} = 0.75\\) \\(Y_{FE} = 1.00\\) Q5. In this exercise, we explore the IS-curve. We have the consumption function of the following form: \\[ C^d = c_0 + c_y (Y-T) - c_r r \\] However, let us assume that there are no taxes in this economy i.e. \\(T = 0\\) and let us assume government spending in this economy reduces private consumption. Think of public health. When government gives you good health care facilities as in Sweden or Norway, you do not spend out of your own pocket on health care. This could be represented as follows: \\[ C^d = c_0 + c_y Y - c_r r - c_g G \\] We have investment in this economy as follows: \\[ I^d = i_0 - i_r r\\] For the following parameter values, find the equation of the IS curve for this economy. variables &lt;- c(&quot;c_0&quot;, &quot;c_y&quot;, &quot;c_r&quot;, &quot;c_g&quot;, &quot;i_0&quot; ,&quot;i_r&quot;, &quot;G&quot;) values &lt;- c(100, 0.8, 500, 0.5, 100, 500, 200) x &lt;- data.frame(variables, values) Parameter Value \\(c_0\\) 100 \\(c_y\\) 0.8 \\(c_r\\) 500 \\(c_g\\) 0.5 \\(i_0\\) 100 \\(i_r\\) 500 \\(G\\) 200 Start with the goods market equilibrium condition: \\[ Y = C^d + I^d + G\\] Simplifying and collecting terms give you: \\[ Y ( 1-c_y) = c_0 + i_0 - c_g \\bar{G} + \\bar{G} - (c_r + i_r) r \\] - Further simplify and substitute parameter values: \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y = \\frac{300}{0.2} - \\frac{1000}{0.2} r \\\\ Y = 1500 - 5000 r \\end{aligned} \\] The correct answer was (a) \\[ Y = 1500 - 5000 r \\] \\[ Y = \\frac{300}{0.2} - \\frac{1000}{0.5} r \\] \\[ Y = \\frac{300}{0.5} - \\frac{1000}{0.2} r \\] \\[ Y = 600 - 10000 r \\] Q6. If the full employment equilibirum for this economy is 1000, what are the equilibrium values for desired consumption and investment? This was a matter of simple substitution after you found equilibrium rate of interest. Consider Desired consumtpion after you solve for equilibrium rate of interest \\(r^*\\) \\[ C^d = 100 + 0.8 ( 1000) - 500(0.1) - 0.5(200) \\] Similarly for Investment The correct answer was (b) \\[ C^d = 750, I^d = 250 \\] \\[ C^d = 750, I^d = 50 \\] \\[ C^d = 550, I^d = 150 \\] \\[ C^d = 500, I^d = 250 \\] General Equilibirum in a Macroeconomic Model Recap: We have all the markets in equilibrium individually. Naturally, the way we have modeled these markets includes specifying their linkages, though we did not explicitly talk about it. Note: Skip this section if you have understood the Lecture on Monday, September 7,2020. To understand this clearly we can write all the equilibrium conditions of the markets and the resultant interlinkages. When we do so, we obtain a complete macroeconomic system. Let us examine the system. The first three expressions are the labor market conditions starting with labor demand \\(N^d\\), labor supply \\(N^s\\) and equilibrium employment \\(N\\). They provide independent pieces of information for solving the model. First tells us the behaior of the firms when the are optimizing agents, Second, tells us the behavior of consumers when they are optimizing their labor supply to maximize their utility. Third tells us about their equilibrium interaction in the market. Similarly the next three equations tell us about the goods market. Notice that the \\(Y^s\\) is the long run supply at full employment. The demand is a resultant of the components demand in the goods market. The third equation tells us that we have IS and FE interaction in equilibrium. The last three equations describe the asset (or money market) in similar fasion. \\[ \\begin{aligned} N^d &amp; = \\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\gamma_2} - \\frac{1}{A \\gamma_2} w \\\\ N^s &amp; = n_{0} + n_1 (1-t) w \\\\ N^d &amp; = N^s = N \\\\ Y^d &amp; = \\frac{c_0 + c_y t_0 + i_0 + G}{1-c_y (1-t)} - \\frac{c_r + i_r}{1-c_y (1-t)} r \\\\ Y^s &amp; = Y_{FE} = A \\Bigg[ \\gamma_1 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg) - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_2 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg)^2 \\Bigg] \\\\ Y^d &amp; = Y^s \\\\ M^d &amp; = l_{0} P + l_y P Y - l_r P (r+\\pi^e) \\\\ M^s &amp; = \\bar{M} \\\\ M^d &amp; = M^s \\end{aligned} \\] We could simplify this system by substituting \\(N^d\\) and \\(N^s\\) as \\(N\\), \\(Y^d\\), \\(Y^s\\) as \\(Y_{FE}\\), and \\(M^d, M^s\\) as \\(\\bar{M}\\). We are doing so to reduce as many varaibles as possible and simplify the system. We are interested in (Y, P and r) in order to draw equivalence between IS-LM and AD-AS equations. \\[ \\begin{aligned} N &amp; = \\frac{\\gamma_1}{\\gamma_2} - \\frac{1}{A \\gamma_2} w \\\\ N &amp; = n_{0} + n_1 (1-t) w \\\\ Y_{FE} &amp; = \\frac{c_0 + c_y t_0 + i_0 + G}{1-c_y (1-t)} - \\frac{c_r + i_r}{1-c_y (1-t)} r \\\\ Y_{FE} &amp; = A \\Bigg[ \\gamma_1 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg) - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_2 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg)^2 \\Bigg] \\\\ \\bar{M} &amp; = l_{0} P + l_y P Y - l_r P (r+\\pi^e) \\\\ M^s &amp; = \\bar{M} \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\] Since there are 6 equations, there are 6 variables which could be solved within the model. They are \\(N, w, r, Y_{FE}, P, M^s\\). The remaining are parameters for the model. We can further reduce this system eliminating \\(N, w\\) and \\(M^s\\) to obtain: \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y_{FE} &amp; = A \\Bigg[ \\gamma_1 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg) - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_2 \\bigg(\\frac{n_0 + n_1 \\gamma_1 A (1-t)}{1 + n_1 \\gamma_2 A (1-t)} \\bigg)^2 \\Bigg] \\\\ Y_{IS} &amp; = \\frac{c_0 + c_y t_0 + i_0 + G}{1-c_y (1-t)} - \\frac{c_r + i_r}{1-c_y (1-t)} r \\\\ Y_{LM} &amp; = \\bigg( \\pi^e - \\frac{l_0}{l_r}\\bigg) \\bigg(\\frac{l_r}{l_y}\\bigg) + \\bigg( \\frac{1}{l_y} \\bigg) \\frac{\\bar{M}}{P} + \\bigg(\\frac{l_r}{l_y}\\bigg) r \\end{aligned} \\] These equations can be solved for three endogenous variables namely - \\(Y, P\\) and \\(r\\), where all other variables are either parameters or exogenous variables treated as “pseudo parameters” Pseudo Parameters: are variables whose values are determined or derived from data. These characterize the economy (\\(A, \\pi^e\\)) and the stance of policy (\\(\\bar{M}, G, t\\)). A: denotes the productivity shock which measures the technological capacity of an economy. \\(\\pi^e\\): denotes the expected inflation \\(\\bar{M}\\) denotes the supply of money by a central bank G denotes total government spending on transfer of ration (provision), building of roads, bridges as well as the money spend paying government employeer. t denotes the average rate of income tax Parameters: are the remaining variables which are neither pseudo parameters nor endogenous variables. \\(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2\\) are production function of labor demand parameters \\(n_0, n_1\\) represent aspects of labor supply function \\(c_0, c_y\\) and \\(c_r\\) represent consumption function parameters \\(i_0, i_r\\) are investment function parameters \\(l_0, l_y, l_r\\) are money demand function parameters. Solution of a model implies finding values of endogenous variables in terms of exogenous variables or parameters. We can use the full employment equilibrium derived earlier (\\(Y_{FE}\\)) in terms as a solution in itself. It only depends upon exogenous variables and parameters. We use this to substitute in the IS curve to obtain equilibrium real interest rate as follows: \\[ Y^* = Y_{FE} \\] Using this to simplify IS curve we obtain \\(r^*\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y_{FE} (1-c_y (1-t)) &amp; = (c_0 + c_y t_0 + i_0 + G) - (c_r + i_r) r \\\\ r^{*} &amp; = \\underbrace{\\frac{(c_0 + c_y t_0 + i_0 + G)}{(c_r + i_r)}}_{\\alpha_{IS}} - \\overbrace{\\frac{(1-c_y (1-t))}{(c_r + i_r)}}^{\\beta_{IS}} Y_{FE} \\end{aligned} \\] We can use this and \\(Y^*\\) to solve for \\(P^*\\) in the LM curve as: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P^* = \\frac{\\bar{M}}{l_y Y_{FE} + l_0 - l_r ( \\pi^e + \\alpha_{IS} - \\beta_{IS} Y_{FE})} \\end{aligned} \\] From the LM equation obtained above: \\[ \\begin{aligned} Y_{LM} &amp; = \\bigg( \\pi^e - \\frac{l_0}{l_r}\\bigg) \\bigg(\\frac{l_r}{l_y}\\bigg) + \\bigg( \\frac{1}{l_y} \\bigg) \\frac{\\bar{M}}{P} + \\bigg(\\frac{l_r}{l_y}\\bigg) r \\\\ r &amp; = \\overbrace{\\bigg(\\frac{l_0}{l_r} - \\pi^e \\bigg) }^{\\alpha_{LM}} - \\frac{1}{l_r} \\frac{\\bar{M}}{P} + \\overbrace{\\bigg(\\frac{l_y}{l_r}\\bigg)}^{\\beta_{LM}} Y \\end{aligned} \\] Substituting \\(r^*\\) obtained previously in the above to eliminate LHS and get a relationship between P and Y in which both goods market and asset market is satisfied. \\[ \\begin{aligned} P^* = \\frac{\\bar{M}}{l_r \\Big[ \\alpha_{LM} - \\alpha_{IS} + (\\beta_{IS} + \\beta_{LM}) Y\\Big]} \\end{aligned} \\] We can simplify this further but to no avail. Note that this is purely a relationship between prices and output when asset and goods market is in equilibrium i.e. the AD curve. Aggregate supply is not uniformly represented in AD-AS models because of the differences in interpretation between classical and Keynesians. Classicals assume that \\(Y = Y_{FE}\\) represents the true long run equilibirum and in the long run we will have the following price and output: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P^* &amp; = \\frac{\\bar{M}}{l_r \\Big[ \\alpha_{LM} - \\alpha_{IS} + (\\beta_{IS} + \\beta_{LM}) Y^*\\Big]} \\\\ Y^* &amp; = Y_{FE} \\end{aligned} \\] On the other hand, Keynesians argue that prices would remain sticky in the short run and there is a possibility of temporary and persistent difference in output from the above \\(Y^{*}\\). This implies that they obtain the following equilibrium values for output and prices: \\[ \\begin{aligned} P^* &amp; = \\bar{P} \\\\ Y^* &amp; = \\frac{\\bar{M}}{\\bar{P}} \\frac{1}{l_r(\\beta_{IS} + \\beta_{LM})} - \\frac{\\alpha_{LM} - \\alpha_{IS}}{\\beta_{IS} + \\beta_{LM}} \\end{aligned} \\] Chapter 11: Numericals P = seq(0, 100, length.out = 1000) AS = 10*P AD = (120/1.5) + (300/1.5) * (1/P) plot(P, AD, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;, main = &quot;Equilibrium in AD and AS&quot;, ylab = &quot;output, Y&quot;) lines(P, AS, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;) quadraticRoots &lt;- function(a, b, c) { print(paste0(&quot;You have chosen the quadratic equation &quot;, a, &quot;x^2 + &quot;, b, &quot;x + &quot;, c, &quot;.&quot;)) discriminant &lt;- (b^2) - (4*a*c) if(discriminant &lt; 0) { return(paste0(&quot;This quadratic equation has no real numbered roots.&quot;)) } else if(discriminant &gt; 0) { x_int_plus &lt;- (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a) x_int_neg &lt;- (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a) return(paste0(&quot;The two x-intercepts for the quadratic equation are &quot;, format(round(x_int_plus, 5), nsmall = 5), &quot; and &quot;, format(round(x_int_neg, 5), nsmall = 5), &quot;.&quot;)) } else #discriminant = 0 case x_int &lt;- (-b) / (2*a) return(paste0(&quot;The quadratic equation has only one root.

["getting-started-with-r.html", "Getting Started with R R for Economists What is R and what is R-studio? The First Step The Second Step Working of R/Python Resources", " Getting Started with R R is a statistical computing platform designed to make data analysis open and scientific. “Open” is for anyone to access understand and replicate. The functionalities of R are open so much so that you can even make your own version of R - though you would be wasting a lot of time! More importantly, open also implies there is no mystery in the job of a statistician or an economist. You can use the methods of hypothesis testing to provide inferences, extrapolate projections etc. as long as you are also following the procedures required by R - which isn’t that much to adhere to. “Scientific” is the approach - the objective of making research and data analysis accessible, replicable and verifiable. You know what you are dealing with at the outset. Work in R studio also makes it easier for others to understand and follow the data explorations of an accomplished statistician. Also, I strongly believe in verifiability of research. It does not matter who a person is, unless he or she gives you replicable research. R for Economists I am an economist and it is fairly important for economists to have a head-start in data analytics. Sadly, we are not taught a lot of practical aspects of data analysis. For eg: which data processing platform should I invest my time during grad school? and why? The fact is that you spend most of your productive time in grad school. If you spend time ineffectively, then it becomes a steeper learning curve later on. Most empirically minded economists use STATA. It is a statistical and data analytics platform which is improving their versatility now with Python integration in Stata 16. As a data analyst, it does makes things a bit easier since you have most of the commands at your menu tabs. It also has strong documentation for its commands and procedures. However, it is not open access platform. More importantly, you start doing data analysis mechanically since you are not hard-coding the commands. Following the data analytics revolution would imply that you follow, get in line, and start learning readable code and use them to write programs which do the same thing as a STATA command. For economists who are used to Stata, switching into R might be a pain but it is worth the transition. First, you would be able to replicate what you read in a textbook to actual readable codes - R codes are as readable as python. Second, you would know the underlying mechanics of your problem and hence be able to communicate research better. Third, with the advent of data science revolution, knowing scientific methods which are closer to modern approach to data science is going to be important. R follows that, and STATA does not. However, your transition to R and your entry into data analytics would be smoother than you imagine. It is also going to take you closer to the idea that everybody can code. And if you have the nerd bone to code, then you are going to get addicted to it. These blogs are part of my efforts to communicate to my students the importance of understanding these data structures. What is R and what is R-studio? R is the original open source platform which helps you practice data science. R is written on C++ and is a higher level programming language with data science functionality added into it. To keep the base lite, R comes with a default platform conducive for analysis. There are purists who practice data science without any additional packages, so that their work remains open source. If you are one of those, then you already know your stuff and you do not have to go through the rest. If not, proceed. R-studio is more of a reception to the data science factory of R. It helps you use R and gives you a more comfortable platform to interact, doing the exact same thing. So all you have to do before beginning with R is to make sure you install R and R-studio separately. Now, you are ready for your revolution into data science. The First Step In this section we will just understand the console space in R-studio; though all these commands will work with R and you do not need R-studio.1 The first command you would learn is dedicated to the first men of programming: print(&quot;hello world&quot;) This is a function - yes the kind you and I were really lazy to learn in our 101 mathematics courses in school and college. It just asks R to print a sentence. Since the sentence is a language and nothing else we needs double quotes to contain a sentence. The sentence is called string of characters in the language of computer programming. So even a space between hello and world is a string which denotes space.2 Notice that print does nothing but reproduces whatever is inside it. Consider another version: print(4+6) This returns 10, but that does not come from the function print itself. It comes from the summation property of numbers pre-coded into R. Hence R can be your basic calculator too! So, now you are starting to get the hang of things. Lets proceed. The Second Step Imagine yourself as a data scientist for a giant conglomerate or a researcher understanding the effects of these conglomerates on global warming. You have churned out a lot of analysis, but forgot to remove them from your computers RAM. You begin the next day and you write this command in the following: rm(list=ls()) This just clears everything in the global environment.3 Now, working directory is the folder in your computer where you want R to store its files. R is installed in your program files / applications folder. But it needs a working directory where it stores its script files. By default R chooses documents. Let us check the working directory from where R is operating. getwd() If its not the same as the one you expected, you would like to change it. This can happen most likely because, you are working on a paper/assignment/project and the data and other details are together in one folder. It is only logical that you also ask R to work from that folder on that project. I usually work from Dropbox and once am finished with a project, either upload it in my website or save it in an external hard drive.4 setwd(&quot;~/Dropbox/your_data_analysis_folder&quot;) So you have changed your working directory to align with your project requirements. Let us list the files in working directory. list.files() To list all the elements in your global environment we run the following command. Again just to caution you to the idea underlying these commands - ls() is actually a function which has certain functions. If you leave it blank and do not provide it any input, its default is to provide you with a list of elements in your global environment. For those who work on R, this is of great help. But R-studio has the global environment on display. ls() You would be wondering, what other inputs can you give the list environment? A simple help command will show you the possibilities. ?ls() More basic commands to examine R’s working directory.

In an era before these higher language programs, we worked with C or C++, in which if you have to define a variable, you had to tell the machine what do you mean by a variable. So you are fundamentally basing off first principles. But for both R and python, basic elements which are common to programming are pre-defined. You can start R and type 2+2 and get the correct answer. It already knows how to do basic math. For more complex tasks, programmers, statisticians, economists, data-analysts and sometimes enthusiastic students such as you have contributed packages. Packages work on top of the base R/python. They extend the capabilities of R. Instead of re-writing R entirely, if I need to code a new Bayesian estimation routine, I just create a package which does that. Lucky for us that most of the common statistical and econometric analysis already has well established package. A collection of packages is called a library. To check which package are installed in our system which came with R-studio, run the following code. library() # Shows the installed packages detach() # Detached packages when no longer need them Once you load a package during a routine analysis, the contents of the package are in the RAM of your computer, which means it slows down your computer. So if you do not need a package, make sure to detach it from the RAM. R says that both these commands are not regularly used. They just give you more information about how R functions with the help of packages saved in its system library.
